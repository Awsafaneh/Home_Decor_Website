        <b>How to Spice Up Your Space in 5 Easy Steps!</b><br />
        Freshen your living space up big-time with some small and affordable changes
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1. Add Depth With a Mirror</b><br />
        <img src="mirror-2158034_640.jpg" /><br />
        Not sure what to do with the empty space in your living room?
        Try an eye-catching floor mirror. Mirrors create the illusion of more space without taking up much room.
        The size of floor mirrors makes them an instant focal point and a mirror hung on the wall lightens up space perfectly without adding color.
        The styles and sizes of mirrors are endless, so there is bound to be one that matches the feel you would like it to bring into your home.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2. Switch Out Your Light Fixtures</b><br />
        <img src="chandelier-52247_640.jpg" /><br />
        Lighting isn’t always something at the top of the list to change up, but it should be!
        A beautiful chandelier in the foyer or dining room will not go unnoticed.
        Choose the design of the chandelier to fit your own decorating style as there are plenty of options to choose from.
        A sleek wall sconce adds a stylish yet necessary light source next to your couch. Put identical sconces on either side of your room
        for a symmetrical and unique take on the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> 3. Textured Pillows</b><br />
        <img src="living-room.jpg" /><br />
        New pillows are one of the easiest ways to change up your living space.
        Try different textures such as mohair fur or fringe to add that extra element of depth and character.
        If texture isn’t your thing, try patterns or colors that complement your furniture. Lighter pillows often complement dark furniture nicely and vice versa.
        Don’t be afraid to go outside of your comfort zone and mix/match colors that you normally wouldn’t.
        Keep it exciting and fun while not overdoing it with a pattern, color, and texture mixing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> 4. Incorporate Wallpaper </b><br />
        <img src="living-room-581073_1920.jpg" /><br />
        Painting is time-consuming and messy, so removable wallpaper is a great alternative! B
        oth subtle and vibrant wallpaper has the ability to transform the entire room. An office,
        bedroom, or living room are all great places to bring in the element of wallpaper.
        Put it on one or two walls so that it doesn’t overwhelm the
        space and add pillows or a throw blanket in the living room to tie in the wallpaper with the rest of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> 5. Change Out Your Rug</b><br />
        <img src="rug-3127149_640.jpg" /><br />
        Rugs are another simple yet impactful way to switch things up when your space is feeling boring. Try a new color scheme for the rug, then change out
        pillows accordingly.  A new rug can easily be the inspiration for the rest of the room,
        as you can play off of those rug colors. Patterns and colors are plentiful when it comes to rugs as well,
        so find the one that inspires you to keep decorating!
