        <b>Home Office Design Basics</b><br />
        8 Tips for creating your ideal homoe office enviorment
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            1. Location, Location, Location
        </b><br />
        <img src="furniture-1840463_640.jpg" /><br />
        You'll likely spend many hours in your home office, so don't stiff yourself on space
        (e.g. squishing a tiny desk into a windowless closet to preserve the rarely-used guest room).
        Also, consider traffic flow and your ability to withstand distractions.
        Do you work best in the thick of activity, or should your office be tucked away in a quiet space?
        If clients will be stopping by, a private space with ample seating is a must.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2. Don't Sacrifice Form for Function</b><br />
        <img src="office-space-1246650_640.jpg" /><br />
        Your desk, shelves and storage should serve you, not the other way around.
        Consider your workflow and what items you need at your fingertips before investing in
        furniture, and then look for pieces that are both beautiful and functional.

        Home office furniture should complement other rooms in your house instead of screaming
        "soulless cubicle." If your home has traditional decor, warm wood and soft, comfy chairs or a loveseat are ideal
        if you have the space. A contemporary home office can feature artistic
        pieces or modern metal furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>3. Invest in a Great Chair</b><br />
        <img src="office-1448219_640.jpg" /><br />
        You spend hours parked in your office chair; a beautiful, ergonomically correct, comfortable seat is worth every dime.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>4. Paint the Walls a Color You Love</b><br />
        <img src="office-594132_640.jpg" /><br />
        Forget "office beige": You need a color that gets your work motor humming. For some people, that's a bright,
        cheery color like orange or lime green. Others need a calming shade like botanical green or sea foam blue to perform.
        Find out more about how certain colors can <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/color/psychology-of-color" target="_blank"> affect your mood.</a>

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>5. Give Yourself a View</b><br />
        <img src="architecture-2804083_640.jpg" /><br />
        Position the desk where you can stare at something more interesting than a blank wall
        (even if you do love the color) when you glance up from the computer. A window's natural light is ideal,
        but if you're in a windowless space, hang a pretty picture above the desk, or position your chair to face the door.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>6. Choose Homey Accessories</b><br />
        <img src="laptop-2234342_1920.jpg" /><br />
        Unless you're going for a contemporary look, choose extras that enhance the comfy feeling of your home office,
        like a pretty mug for a pencil holder, trendy notepads and sticky notes, and a decorative waste basket. Wrap your bulletin board in a gorgeous fabric, and hide utilitarian
        bookshelves behind curtains made from the same material. Hang inspirational prints on the walls,
        whether that's simply your kids' framed artwork or a classic painting.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>7. Master Your Technology </b><br />
        <img src="office-932926_1920.jpg" /><br />
        There's not much you can do to beautify the computer, printer and phone, but you can hide unsightly cords. Start by making sure your
        equipment is close to outlets and easy to access if you need to unplug. Encase cords on the desk in a fabric cord cover, and feed the cords into a desk grommet,
        a plastic or metal cap that helps guide cords through a hole in the desk and hides them underneath.
        Tame the cord jungle on the floor with cord winders, tubing, or a wire organizer that's attached to the desk and lifts the cords off the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>8. Inspire yourself </b><br />
        <img src="laptop-4932432_640.jpg" /><br />
        Set up a mini-shrine — a few cherished knickknacks, a piece of framed art, a special photo on your desk — that motivates you to create and/or
        get the work done so you can get out of there.
        A print of Paris can channel your inner muse, or a photo of your children might remind you that you're doing it all for them.
