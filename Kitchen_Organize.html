            <b>How to Organize Your Kitchen—Once and for All</b> <br />

            If you’ve searched endlessly for the right tupperware lid, bought double the ingredients because you couldn’t find it in your pantry or struggle
            to keep the kitchen looking even somewhat clean, then it might be time to give your kitchen some attention. Contrary to what a lot of people think,
            you don’t need an enormous space to have a functional kitchen – it’s more about how you organize the space you do have!
            <br />
            You also don’t need a major overhaul to banish clutter and become organized – just a few handy tips and tricks to get you started.
            Here’s what we suggest to optimize your space and get a functional kitchen space you actually enjoy being in!
            <br /><br />

            Pull it Out and Purge
            <br /><br />
            To start, it’s important to literally see every item in your kitchen and start from a blank slate. So pull it all out and assess the damage!

            Think about each item: is it necessary? Does it work? Do I love it?

            This step can be really hard but consider the goals – to have a functional space, to have as clear a counter as possible,
            and to actually enjoy being in the kitchen. Once you’ve gone through your items, you should have a keep section, a toss section and a donate section.
            <br /><br />

            Do a Deep Clean

            <br /><br />
            Because you have everything out of your cabinets and drawers,
            this is the perfect time to give everything a good wipe down. You’d be surprised how great that will feel, especially when you go to put everything back in its place.

            Position Correctly
            <br /><br />

            Now that you know which items go where, think about how you position them. Keep items you use the most at eye level and the pieces that see a
            little less use further away or up higher.
            If you can’t easily see or access something, the less likely you are to use it.

            Same goes for the pantry! Consider unloading cereals, baking goods, pasta and rice for instance, into clear containers.
            You’ll have more room, they will keep better and you’ll actually be able to see everything! Position things you use the most, like cereal, where it’s easiest to access.
            Get Creative
            <br /><br />
            Want to take it a step further? Start to get creative with your organization and determine which hacks will work best in each zone.
            For example:<br />
            Install a hanging rack for pots and pans to free up cupboard space
            Mount a rack for spices and actually alphabetize it
            Have a tall pantry door? Hang a clear shoe organizer to make use of that space
            Make use of drawer organizers and dividers to keep everything super accessible
            Use standing dividers for things like baking sheets and cutting boards

            <br /><br />
            Keep On It

            <br /><br />
            After a month, take a moment to reflect on how the organization is going.
            Define any problem areas and reevaluate. Try to stay on top of the pantry and make it a yearly goal to do a declutter.
