        <b>7 Easy, Pro-Approved Tricks to Make Your Kitchen Beautiful and Organized</b><br />
        Learn the art of kitchen remodeling
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1. Introduce a Pop of Pattern</b><br />
        <img src="kitchen-2565105_1920.jpg" /><br />
        In the Real Simple Home, Garlough added an accent wall with removable striped wallpaper (it's this wallpaper from Joss & Main).
        The painterly lines give the modern space a handmade touch, while the neutral color
        palette helps it look cohesive with the rest of the space. To work this idea into your own home, consider installing a touch of zero-commitment removable wallpaper.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> 2. Add Pattern Inside the Cabinets, Too </b><br />
        <img src="kitchen-1543493_1920.jpg" /><br />
        To give your kitchen some personality, go ahead and add pattern
        in an unexpected spot, like inside the cabinets.
        Again, removable wallpaper makes the install relatively easy and you can always switch it out when you need a change.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> 2. Don't Forget the Art</b><br />
        <img src="kitchen-1687121_640.jpg" /><br />
        The kitchen counter probably isn't the first place you think to add artwork, but Garlough points out that introducing personal
        touches like art can really warm up an otherwise cold kitchen.
        An added bonus: when strategically placed, the art can also help conceal electrical outlets.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> 4. Install Suction Hooks</b><br />
        <img src="coffee-3535463_640.jpg" /><br />
        To give your kitchen some personality, go ahead and add pattern
        in an unexpected spot, like inside the cabinets.
        Again, removable wallpaper makes the install relatively easy and you can always switch it out when you need a change.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> 5. Choose the Best Bar Stools</b><br />
        <img src="kitchen-1940174_1920.jpg" /><br />
        If you have an open floor plan, then it's important to choose bar stools that work with the decor on both sides of the room.
        In the Real Simple Home's kitchen, Garlough selected these gorgeous bar stools ($325, jossandmain.com) that were modern,
        but with a curved back to soften the look. Plus, the seats swivel so those seated at the kitchen counter can easily turn to
        chat with those sitting on the living room couch.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>6. Squeeze Storage Into Every Corner</b><br />
        <img src="hospitality-3793946_640.jpg" /><br />
        No matter the size of your kitchen, we all want to fit in more storage.
        Garlough recommends a clever shelving unit designed to
        fit into that empty corner of the room. Now, an underutilized space can hold knick-knacks, photos, and cookbooks.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>7. Always Add Plants</b><br />
        <img src="centerpiece-714019_1920.jpg" /><br />
        No room is complete without a house plant. In this space, Garlough opted for a hanging plant that will trail down as it grows.
        Consider your own kitchen, then choose the plant that would work best
        for your space, whether it's a small windowsill garden, a hanging pothos plant, or a large fiddle fig.
